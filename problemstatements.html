            <h4>
                <h4>Repository Management:</h4>
                <p>Users can create and manage repositories specific to their
                    neural network
                    projects. Each repository acts as a centralized hub for storing and organizing code, data,
                    and
                    model files.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Version Control: </h4>
                <p>The website employs advanced version control techniques to track changes made to neural
                    network models over time. Users can create branches, commit changes, merge branches, and
                    roll back to previous versions effortlessly.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Collaboration and Permissions: </h4>
                <p>Collaborators can be invited to contribute to repositories, allowing seamless teamwork on
                    neural network projects. Granular permission settings enable administrators to control read,
                    write, and merge access for each collaborator.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Code Review:</h4>
                <p>It should faciliate code review processes, allowing collaborators to provide feedback,
                    suggest improvements, and ensure the quality of code before merging changes into the main
                    branch.</p>

                <h4>Track Activities:</h4>
                <p>Record your daily activities with ease. Whether you're walking, running, cycling, swimming,
                    or engaging in strength training, FitnessTracker allows you to track the duration of each
                    activity. Simply select the activity type and enter the duration in minutes, and the app
                    will keep a log of your progress.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Monitor Your Progress: </h4>
                <p>Stay informed about your progress towards your goals. FitnessTracker provides an overview of
                    your goal type, such as steps, calories burned, or distance covered, along with your set
                    goal value. It also displays your current progress, allowing you to see how close you are to
                    achieving your objectives.</p>

                <h4>Natural Language Understanding: :</h4>
                <p>ThisApp employs state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to comprehend and
                    interpret user queries accurately. It can understand context, detect intent, and extract
                    relevant information from user inputs.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Contextual Dialogues: </h4>
                <p> The app is capable of maintaining context throughout conversations, enabling more coherent
                    and human-like interactions. It remembers previous user inputs and uses this information to
                    provide relevant responses and recommendations.</p>

            <p>The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can effectively
                analyze medical data to aid healthcare professionals in disease diagnosis or prognosis. The
                model will be capable of handling two types of medical data: medical images (such as X-rays,
                MRI scans, or histopathology images) and patient records (including clinical notes,
                laboratory results, and demographic information).</p>

            <h3>Fraud Detection:</h3>
            <h4>
                <h4>Anomaly Detection:</h4>
                <p>FraudGuard employs anomaly detection algorithms to identify patterns and behaviors that
                    deviate significantly from normal transactional patterns. It analyzes various attributes and
                    characteristics of transactions to identify potential fraudulent activities.</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <h4>Real-time Monitoring:</h4>
                <p> The model continuously monitors incoming transactions in real-time, allowing for prompt
                    detection of fraudulent behavior. It quickly flags suspicious transactions or activities,
                    providing businesses with immediate alerts and notifications.</p>

                <p> EcoChain enables transparent tracking of donations, ensuring that funds are utilized as
                    intended. By recording donation transactions on the blockchain, donors can have visibility
                    into how their contributions are being used and monitor the impact created.</p>
